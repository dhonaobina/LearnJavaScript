## Exercise 1 - Formatting Numbers
You can format the numbers in JavaScript by using the various built-in methods such as toFixed() and toPrecision().

The toFixed() method helps to display the number with the required number of decimal values. This method returns a string value. The toFixed() method takes a single parameter. You can also use this method without any parameter.

The toPrecision() method helps to display the number with the required length or precision. This method also returns a string value. The toPrecision() method takes a single parameter that is optional.

In this exercise, the first task will be to download the Visual Studio Code workspace from the Intranet and create a new HTML page named Formatnum.html in the Calculator workspace.

In the second task, you will write JavaScript code to use the built-in number methods to format the numbers.
